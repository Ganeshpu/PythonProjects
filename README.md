Python Projects: Below I have put in jupyter notebook files of python code. These set of files have various projects
I have done as part of my python learning journey: These projects use python libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn,matplotlib
sklearn, cufflinks etc. Each project is focused on single topic and topics include: Linear regression, logistic regression,
KNN classification. 
Also I have included projects which focus on data visualization using Seabor, matplotlib, cufflinks, pandas, plotly.
** IF YOU ARE UNABLE TO OPEN ipynb FILES IN GIT HUB PLEASE DOWNLOAD IT AND THEN OPEN IN JUPYTER NOTEBOOK.
